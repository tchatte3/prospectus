In the current chapter we report the computational domain and the results of the precursor simulation to the wind turbine array, which in this case is neutral atmospheric boundary layer at very high $Re$ and single wind condition. A rigorous parametric study has been performed on the subgrid-scale model as well as on the near wall modelling paramters, and the best model has been chosen based on the analysis of the results that will be used subsequently in all the models involving wind turbine array simulation. The proper knowledge of ABL precursor simulation is necessary since it is being used as a realistic inflow condition to drive flow past wind turbine arrays.
